                <h3 class="subheading">MG Car Discounts:Gloster</h3>
                <p>MG Motor is expected to launch the Gloster facelift in India by the end of the year. In anticipation of the new model’s arrival, the automaker is offering attractive benefits worth up to ₹6 lakh at the dealer level on the current Gloster model. The MG Gloster is a feature-rich SUV that boasts a premium cabin. Despite offering more equipment than the Toyota Fortuner, it has not been a top contender in its segment. To clear existing stock before the facelift arrives, MG is offering its biggest discount yet. The MG Gloster is currently priced between ₹47 lakh and ₹53.30 lakh (on-road, Mumbai).</p>
                <h3 class="subheading">MG Hector: Up to ₹3 Lakh Off</h3>

                <p>The MG Astor, due for an update in the international market soon, is available with discounts of up to ₹2 lakh this month.

The MG Astor is powered by a 1.5-litre naturally aspirated petrol engine or a 1.3-litre turbo petrol engine, with options for a 5-speed manual transmission, CVT, or 6-speed automatic gearbox. The MG Astor is currently priced between ₹11.68 lakh and ₹21.36 lakh (on-road, Mumbai), before the discounts. </p>
                <h3 class="subheading">MG ZS EV: ₹2.2 Lakh Off</h3>
