                    <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 text-center image-height"><img src="~/images/blogs/2025/dec/kia seltos/header1.webp" alt="header" title="header" loading="lazy" /></div>

                <h3 class="subheading">Design Philosophy: Commanding Presence and Bolder Stance</h3>
                <p>The moment one lays eyes on the all-new Seltos, it's clear that Kia's designers have embraced an aggressive, modern aesthetic while maintaining the vehicle's instantly recognizable silhouette. The exterior design has been meticulously re-sculpted, giving the Seltos a larger, more planted, and commanding presence on the road.</p>
                <p><span class="font-weight-700">The Kia Digital Tiger Face</span></p>
                <p>At the heart of the front-end redesign is the <span class="font-weight-700">Commanding Kia Digital Tiger Face with a Black High Glossy Grille. </span>This revised grille design is more angular and prominent, seamlessly flowing into the signature lighting elements. The headlamps, now featuring<span class="font-weight-700"> Intense Ice Cube LED Projection Headlamps with Star Map LED DRLs,</span> create a distinct visual signature both day and night.</p>
                <p>The front bumper is reworked to appear more robust, incorporating<span class="font-weight-700"> High-Clarity LED Front Fog Lamps and Robust Front & Rear Skid Plates with Dark Gunmetal Finish, </span>signaling its readiness for adventure, whether navigating city traffic or exploring the open highway.</p>
                <div class="row m-b20">
                    <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 text-center image-height"><img src="~/images/blogs/2025/dec/kia seltos/speaker.webp" alt="speaker" title="speaker" loading="lazy" /></div>
                </div>



                <p><span class="font-weight-700">Profile and Rear Evolution</span></p>
                <p>Viewing the Seltos from the side reveals an extended silhouette, which is a direct result of the increased dimensions of the all-new model. The Seltos now stands at 4,460 mm in length and features an extended wheelbase of 2,690 mm, translating directly into enhanced cabin space. The sleek side profile is accentuated by <span class="font-weight-700">Automatic Streamline Door Handles and Premium Side Door Garnish with Body Color Accents.</span></p>
                <div class="row m-b20">
                    <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 text-center image-height"><img src="~/images/blogs/2025/dec/kia seltos/lock.webp" alt="lock" title="lock" loading="lazy" /></div>
                </div>



                <p>A notable design highlight is the new wheel design. The Seltos rides on <span class="font-weight-700">Iconic R18 - 46.20 cm (18") Sporty Crystal Cut Alloy Wheels</span> that boast a dynamic look and feature striking <span class="font-weight-700">Neon Brake Calipers</span> on the performance-oriented variants, adding a sporty and premium touch.</p>
                <p>The rear of the Seltos sees perhaps the most dramatic change with the introduction of the <span class="font-weight-700">Striking Star Map LED Connected Tail Lamps. </span>These new lamps span the width of the tailgate, creating a sophisticated and futuristic light signature that elevates the car's premium quotient. This is topped off by an<span class="font-weight-700"> Integrated Rear Spoiler with LED High Mount Stop Lamp. </span>The overall exterior makeover makes the Seltos look undeniably contemporary and aggressive, reinforcing its 'Badass' identity.</p>

                <p>Below the main display, the climate control system is elegantly managed via a separate <span class="font-weight-700"> 5-inch climate control screen, </span>ensuring a cleaner, more organized central console. For ultimate passenger comfort, the Seltos also features a<span class="font-weight-700">  Dual-Zone Fully Automatic Air Conditioner,</span> allowing the driver and front passenger to set their own preferred temperatures.</p>
                <p><span class="font-weight-700"> Premium Features for Utmost Convenience</span></p>
