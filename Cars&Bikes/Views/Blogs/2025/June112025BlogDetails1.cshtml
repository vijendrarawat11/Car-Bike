                    <h3 class="subheading">Introduction</h3>
                    <p><span class="font-weight-700">Royal Enfield</span> has long been synonymous with classic motorcycles that evoke a sense of nostalgia and adventure. From its timeless Bullet to the modern Himalayan 450, the brand continues to evolve while staying true to its heritage. The next chapter in this journey comes with the much-anticipated <span class="font weight 700">Royal Enfield Guerrilla 450</span> — a stylish, lightweight, urban-focused roadster designed to appeal to a new generation of riders.</p>

                    <p>Built on the platform of the recently launched Himalayan 450, the Guerrilla 450 promises to blend modern performance with retro design. It is being positioned as an everyday street motorcycle that offers both practicality and excitement. Here's everything you need to know about the <span class="font-weight-700">Royal Enfield Guerrilla 450:</span> <span class="font-weight-600">Expected price, features, specifications, and more.</span></p>
                    <div class="div-line"></div>

                    <h3 class="subheading">Royal Enfield Guerrilla 450 Overview</h3>
                    <p>The <span class="font-weight-700">Royal Enfield Guerrilla 450</span> is a neo-retro roadster aimed squarely at urban riders. It will share its underpinnings with the Himalayan 450 adventure motorcycle, which means it will likely be powered by the same all-new <span class="font-weight-700">452cc liquid-cooled sherpa engine</span>.</p>

                    <p>Unlike the Himalayan, which is purpose-built for off-road exploration, the Guerrilla 450 will have a more street-friendly design and ergonomics. Its goal is to compete with modern roadsters and street bikes while maintaining Royal Enfield's signature old-school charm.</p>

                    <p>This motorcycle will slot above the popular <span class="font-weight-700">Hunter 350</span> in RE's portfolio and is expected to target young riders who want a stylish, powerful, and versatile motorcycle for daily use and occasional weekend rides.</p>
                    <div class="div-line"></div>

                    <h3 class="subheading">Launch Timeline</h3>
                    <p>While Royal Enfield has yet to officially reveal the Guerrilla 450, several test mules have already been spotted on Indian roads, indicating that the bike is in the final stages of testing.</p>

                    <p>Industry insiders and media reports suggest that the Guerrilla 450 could make its global debut as early as <span class="font-weight-700">July 2024</span>, with the Indian launch expected to follow in <span class="font-weight-700">late Q3 or early Q4 of 2024</span>. If all goes to plan, Royal Enfield may begin deliveries by <span class="font-weight-700">Festive Season 2024</span>, making it one of the most exciting new motorcycles to hit the Indian market this year.</p>
                    <div class="div-line"></div>

                    <h3 class="subheading">Expected Price in India</h3>
                    <p>Pricing will be one of the key factors in the Guerrilla 450's appeal. Based on its positioning and shared components with the Himalayan 450, the Guerrilla 450 is expected to be priced between <span class="font-weight-700">₹2.39 lakh to ₹2.54 lakh (ex-showroom)</span>.</p>

                    <p>This would make it a very attractive option for riders looking to step up from the 350cc segment without breaking the bank. In comparison:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="font-weight-700">Royal Enfield Hunter 350</span>: ₹1.49 lakh to ₹1.81 lakh</li>
                        <li><span class="font-weight-700">Royal Enfield Himalayan 450</span>: ₹2.85 lakh to ₹2.98 lakh</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The Guerrilla 450 is expected to undercut the Himalayan slightly while offering similar performance in a more road-oriented package.</p>

                        <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 text-center image-height"><img src="~/images/blogs/2025/june/royal enfield guerrilla 450/side.webp" alt="bikecarhub Royal Enfield Guerilla" title="bikecarhub Royal Enfield " /></div>

                    <div class="div-line"></div>

                    <h3 class="subheading">Design & Styling</h3>
                    <p><span class="font-weight-700">Royal Enfield</span> is known for blending classic design cues with modern engineering, and the Guerrilla 450 will continue this tradition.</p>

                    <p>Based on spy shots and reports, here's what can be expected:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="font-weight-700">Retro-inspired design</span> with modern elements</li>
                        <li><span class="font-weight-700">Round LED headlamp</span> with chrome or black bezel</li>
                        <li><span class="font-weight-700">Sculpted fuel tank</span> with knee recesses for better grip</li>
                        <li><span class="font-weight-700">Flat, wide handlebar</span> for a comfortable upright riding posture</li>
                        <li><span class="font-weight-700">Minimalist rear end</span> with a compact LED taillight</li>
                        <li><span class="font-weight-700">Black-out alloy wheels</span> (likely 17-inch front and rear)</li>
                        <li>Color options are likely to include <span class="font-weight-600">classic RE shades</span> like Brave Blue, Playa Black, Yellow Ribbon and perhaps a couple of vibrant options for younger buyers.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Overall, the Guerrilla 450 will have a <span class="font-weight-700">clean, purposeful, and muscular appearance</span> designed for the urban jungle.</p>
                    <div class="div-line"></div>

                    <h3 class="subheading">Engine & Performance</h3>
                    <p>Under the skin, the Guerrilla 450 will most likely use the <span class="font-weight-600">new Sherpa 450 engine</span> from the Himalayan 450. This is an all-new liquid-cooled single-cylinder engine designed to meet modern performance and emission standards.</p>

                    <p><span class="font-weight-700">Expected Engine Specs:</span></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="font-weight-700">Displacement</span>: 452cc</li>
                        <li><span class="font-weight-700">Engine Type</span>: Liquid-cooled, single-cylinder, DOHC</li>
                        <li><span class="font-weight-700">Power</span>: 40 PS@8,000 rpm</li>

                        <li><span class="font-weight-700">Gearbox</span>: 6-speed with slipper clutch</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This engine is known for its strong low-end and mid-range torque, making it ideal for city riding and occasional highway cruising.</p>
                    <div class="div-line"></div>

                    <h2 class="subheading">Chassis, Suspension & Braking</h2>
                    <p>The Guerrilla 450 will feature a <span class="font-weight-700">twin-spar steel frame</span>, similar to the Himalayan 450 but with geometry optimized for street riding.</p>

                    <p><span class="font-weight-700">Expected Hardware:</span></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="font-weight-700">Front Suspension</span>: 43mm USD forks (shorter travel than Himalayan)</li>
                        <li><span class="font-weight-700">Rear Suspension</span>: Monoshock with preload adjustment</li>
                        <li><span class="font-weight-700">Front Brake</span>: 320mm disc with dual-channel ABS</li>
                        <li><span class="font-weight-700">Rear Brake</span>: 270mm disc with dual-channel ABS</li>
                        <li><span class="font-weight-700">Wheels</span>: 17-inch alloys front and rear (wrapped in road-biased rubber)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This setup should provide <span class="font-weight-700">sharp handling</span> in city conditions while offering enough stability for spirited weekend rides.</p>
                    <div class="row m-b20">
