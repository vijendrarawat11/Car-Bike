                <p>The name Benelli evokes a rich history of Italian passion, performance, and distinctive design. In the modern era, the brand, now under the Qianjiang Group, has successfully balanced its storied heritage with accessible, feature-rich motorcycling. Few models embody this duality better than the <span class="font-weight-700">Leoncino </span>(Italian for "Lion Cub") series. With the middleweight segment heating up globally, the arrival of the full-fledged <span class="font-weight-700">Benelli Leoncino 800</span> is one of the most exciting prospects on the horizon.</p>
                <p>Scheduled for an expected launch in <span class="font-weight-700">December 2025,</span> the Leoncino 800 is positioned to be Benelli’s flagship neo-retro roadster, competing directly with high-capacity models from Europe and Japan. It aims to offer a step-up experience from the popular Leoncino 500, delivering more power, better components, and a greater sense of occasion. For premium motorcycle enthusiasts tracking the latest launches on platforms like <a class="for-link" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Index">BikeCarHub</a>  this motorcycle promises a powerful blend of classic scrambler aesthetics and modern, spirited performance.</p>
                <p>This comprehensive analysis delves into the expected specifications, anticipated performance characteristics, projected pricing, and the key features that will allow the Leoncino 800 to command attention in the competitive landscape. Every detail here is based on industry insights and Benelli’s global model strategy, offering an exciting preview of this upcoming Italian machine.</p>
                <h3 class="subheading">Design and Aesthetic Identity: The Roaring Lion Cub</h3>
                <div class="row m-b20">
                    <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 text-center image-height"><img src="~/images/twowheeler/upcomming/2025/benelli leoncino 800/blue.webp" alt="blue" title="blue" loading="lazy" /></div>
                </div>
                <p>The Leoncino family is defined by its clean, timeless design that cleverly integrates modern elements without sacrificing its retro charm. The Leoncino 800 will inherit this DNA but with a bulkier, more substantial presence befitting its engine capacity.</p>
                <p><span class="font-weight-700">Signature Styling and Presence</span></p>
                <p>The key design element that defines the Leoncino aesthetic will remain: the small, proud <span class="font-weight-700">Lion of Pesaro</span> emblem mounted on the front fender. The 800 model will amplify the existing design language:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-700">Round LED Headlamp:</span> A signature round headlamp unit featuring a sophisticated, integrated <span class="font-weight-700">LED Daytime Running Light (DRL) </span>ring. This ensures a classic front profile with modern illumination performance.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-700">Muscular Fuel Tank: </span>The tank capacity is expected to be generous, around 15 Litres, with deep knee recesses for better rider grip and a sculpted look that emphasizes the bike's powerful stance.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-700">Minimalist Seat:</span> A flat, single-piece or slightly stepped seat with quality upholstery (often black or brown) will be used, maintaining the scrambler/roadster purity.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-700">Exposed Trellis Frame</span>: The use of a visible <span class="font-weight-700">Steel Trellis Frame, </span>painted in a contrasting colour, will be a core design feature, showcasing the bike’s mechanical elegance—a true nod to Italian naked bike design.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><span class="font-weight-700">Ergonomics for Performance and Comfort</span></p>
                <p>The riding posture of the Leoncino 800 is expected to be a balanced compromise, offering a comfortable, slightly upright stance suitable for daily commutes and light touring, yet aggressive enough for spirited riding.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-700">Handlebar Position: </span>Wide, slightly raised handlebars (often referred to as 'fat bars') will provide excellent leverage for quick steering and a classic scrambler feel.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-700">Footpeg Placement: </span>Mid-set footpegs will ensure a natural knee angle and allow the rider to easily shift weight during hard cornering.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-700">High-Mounted Exhaust:</span> Similar to other scrambler offerings, a <span class="font-weight-700">high-mounted twin exhaust </span>system with stacked mufflers is a distinct possibility, enhancing both the look and the ground clearance.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><span class="font-weight-700">Performance Specifications</span></p>
                <p>This engine is expected to be a performance leader in the mid-to-high capacity neo-retro segment, providing exhilarating acceleration and cruising speed.</p><div style="overflow-x: auto;">

                </div>
                <p>To handle the potent <span class="font-weight-700">76.2 HP engine, the Leoncino 800</span> will be built on a high-specification chassis, featuring top-tier components that are a hallmark of Benelli’s premium offerings.</p>
                <p><span class="font-weight-700">Frame and Weight</span></p>
                <p>The use of a sturdy <span class="font-weight-700">Steel Trellis Frame </span>is critical for providing the necessary rigidity and feedback.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-700">Wet Weight:</span> Given the large engine, chassis, and premium components, the Leoncino 800 will be substantial, likely weighing around 234 kg wet. This weight contributes to stability at high speeds but requires careful management.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><span class="font-weight-700">High-Spec Suspension</span></p>
                <p>The suspension is where Benelli typically outperforms its rivals in terms of quality and adjustability.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-700">Front Suspension:</span> High-performance <span class="font-weight-700">50 mm Marzocchi Upside Down (USD) Forks. </span>These are expected to be<span class="font-weight-700"> fully adjustable</span> (preload, compression, and rebound), offering the rider a high degree of customization for different terrains and riding styles—a truly premium feature.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-700">Rear Suspension:</span> A single, centrally mounted <span class="font-weight-700">Monoshock Absorber</span> with linkage, likely adjustable for preload and rebound. This offers superior damping and stability compared to twin shock setups.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><span class="font-weight-700">Braking Excellence</span></p>
                <p>Stopping power will be equally impressive, ensuring safety and confidence under all conditions.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-700">Front Brakes: </span>Dual 320 mm floating discs, clamped by high-specification <span class="font-weight-700">Brembo or J.Juan radial-mount calipers.</span> This setup provides phenomenal stopping power and feel.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-700">Rear Brakes:</span> Single 260 mm disc.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-700">Safety: Dual-Channel ABS </span>will be standard across all variants.</li>

                <p>The <span class="font-weight-700">Leoncino 800</span> is a road-biased scrambler, meaning it needs robust components for light off-roading but must maintain excellent on-road handling.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-700">Wheels: Spoked wheels </span>are standard for a scrambler, sized at 17′′ <span class="font-weight-700">both front and rear,</span> fitted with road-biased but block-pattern dual-purpose tires to hint at its versatile capability.</li>

                The 2025 <span class="font-weight-700">Leoncino 800</span> will need to feature a contemporary electronics package to justify its premium segment positioning.
                <p><span class="font-weight-700">Instrumentation and Display</span></p>
                <p>The bike will be equipped with a high-visibility, full-colour <span class="font-weight-700">TFT instrument cluster.</span></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-700">Display Features: </span>The TFT screen will offer multiple display modes (e.g., retro vs. modern), displaying essential information like gear position, fuel level, clock, and average speed.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-700">Connectivity: Bluetooth connectivity </span>for pairing with a smartphone, offering call alerts, music control, and possibly <span class="font-weight-700">basic turn-by-turn navigation</span> via a mobile app.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><span class="font-weight-700">Advanced Electronic Features</span></p>
                <p>While Benelli often focuses on core mechanical quality, essential rider aids are expected:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-700">Ride-by-Wire (RbW): </span>The use of RbW is expected, which is necessary for precise throttle control and the implementation of electronic rider aids.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-700">Riding Modes: </span>At least two distinct riding modes<span class="font-weight-700"> (Road and Rain) </span>are anticipated, which would adjust throttle sensitivity and ABS intervention.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-700">LED Lighting: </span>Full LED lighting across the board—headlamp, tail lamp, and turn indicators.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This high level of electronic integration, particularly the fully adjustable suspension and the powerful braking system, places the<span class="font-weight-700"> Benelli Leoncino 800 </span>as a strong technical contender in the segment, a point of pride for riders reading <span class="font-weight-700">BikeCarHub.</span></p>

                <p>Benelli’s pricing strategy is typically aggressive, aiming to undercut European rivals while offering competitive components. The 800cc class commands a significant premium.</p>

                <p>The Leoncino 800 will be positioned as a performance and component step-up from the existing Leoncino 500 and Benelli TRK 502.</p>

                    <li><span class="font-weight-700"> Variants:</span> Benelli might offer two variants, a <span class="font-weight-700"> Standard </span>roadster model, and potentially a <span class="font-weight-700"> Trail/Scrambler </span>version with wire-spoked wheels, a high fender, and slightly longer suspension travel, though the focus here remains on the base roadster/scrambler model.</li>

                <p><span class="font-weight-700"> Projected Colour Variants</span></p>

                <p><span class="font-weight-700">Strategic Positioning Analysis</span></p>
                <p>The <span class="font-weight-700">Benelli Leoncino 800 </span>is expected to directly target the <span class="font-weight-700">Ducati Scrambler</span> on style and the <span class="font-weight-700">Triumph Scrambler</span> 900 on presence, while offering technical specifications (like the 50 mm fully adjustable USD forks) that are demonstrably superior to its closest price competitors. Although the <span class="font-weight-700">BMW F 900 R </span>is more powerful and electronically advanced, the Leoncino provides a massive 76 PS output at a more accessible price point, combining Italian roadster aggression with excellent value. Its powerful engine and premium, often oversized, components will make it a very attractive choice for riders looking for a performance-oriented neo-retro machine.</p>
                <h3 class="subheading">Conclusion: A Strong Contender in the Premium Neo-Retro Space</h3>
                <p>The anticipated launch of the<span class="font-weight-700"> Benelli Leoncino 800 (2025) </span>is poised to shake up the premium middleweight segment. Benelli is clearly aiming for a knockout punch by combining a powerful, characterful 754cc parallel-twin engine with componentry typically seen on much higher-priced European machines—notably the 50 mm <span class="font-weight-700">fully adjustable Marzocchi USD forks.</span></p>
                <p>The Leoncino 800 promises to be a motorcycle that not only looks classically beautiful but rides with a modern, exhilarating intensity. Its strong 76 PS power delivery, combined with the excellent stopping power of its high-spec brakes, ensures that the bike is far more than just a style statement. If the final pricing is as competitive as expected, the Leoncino 800 will be a force to reckon with, offering riders a slice of Italian flair and a whole lot of riding pleasure. We eagerly await its official debut!</p>
