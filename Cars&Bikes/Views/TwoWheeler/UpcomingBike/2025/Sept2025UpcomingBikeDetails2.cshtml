                <p>The motorcycle world is constantly evolving, and a new trend is taking shape: the flat tracker. These bikes, with their minimalist design, elevated exhaust pipes, and a rugged, purpose-built aesthetic, are a true nod to a bygone era of racing. Now, it seems a legendary name is ready to enter this segment in India. We're talking about the highly anticipated  <span class="font-weight-700">Triumph Speed 400 Tracker. </span>While the Speed 400 and Scrambler 400 X have already made a significant impact on the Indian market, this new model promises to offer something unique—a blend of classic flat-track styling with the accessible performance and modern technology that the 400 series is known for. </p>
                <p>For riders who appreciate a motorcycle that looks just as good parked outside a cafe as it does kicking up dust on a trail, the Speed 400 Tracker is poised to be a game-changer. The buzz and spy shots circulating online suggest that Triumph is not just creating another variant but a machine with its own distinct personality. The motorcycle is expected to leverage the same platform as its siblings while introducing design elements and features that set it apart. As we at <a class="for-link" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Index">BikeCarHub</a> have been following its development, we can tell you that the excitement is real, and the potential of this bike is immense. </p>
                <h3 class="subheading">The Expected Timeline and Price: What to Expect</h3>
                <div class="row m-b20">
                    <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 text-center image-height">
                        <img src="~/images/twowheeler/upcomming/2025/triumph/triumph back.webp"
                             alt=" triumph back " title=" triumph back " loading="lazy" />
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>The new  <span class="font-weight-700">Triumph Speed 400 Tracker</span> has been a subject of speculation for some time now, with spy shots fuelling the anticipation. While an official launch date has yet to be announced by Triumph, industry insiders and reports suggest that the bike is likely to make its debut in India around  <span class="font-weight-700">October 2025. </span>This timeline is, of course, subject to change, but it gives us a good idea of when we can finally see this motorcycle in Triumph showrooms. </p>
                <p>In terms of pricing, the Triumph Speed 400 Tracker is expected to be positioned strategically to attract a new wave of buyers. It is anticipated to be priced slightly higher than the Speed 400 but below the Scrambler 400 X. The <span class="font-weight-700"> ex-showroom price</span> is expected to be in the range of  <span class="font-weight-700">₹2.55 Lakh to ₹2.60 Lakh. </span>This pricing would make it an incredibly attractive proposition for those looking for a premium, stylish, and capable motorcycle without breaking the bank. The on-road price will, as always, vary based on regional taxes and charges. </p>
                <h3 class="subheading">A Deeper Look at the Specifications</h3>
                <div class="row m-b20">
                    <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 text-center image-height">
                        <img src="~/images/twowheeler/upcomming/2025/triumph/triumph red.webp"
                             alt=" triumph red " title=" triumph red " loading="lazy" />
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>The  <span class="font-weight-700">Triumph Speed 400 Tracker</span> is expected to be built on the same successful platform as the Speed 400 and Scrambler 400 X. This means it will share the same robust and reliable engine. The motorcycle will likely be powered by a  <span class="font-weight-700">398.15cc, liquid-cooled, single-cylinder, DOHC engine, </span> which is well-regarded for its tractable power delivery and spirited performance. This engine is tuned to produce a healthy  <span class="font-weight-700">40 PS of peak power at 8,000 rpm and 37.5 Nm of maximum torque at 6,500 rpm. </span>The smooth power delivery is a key highlight, making the bike equally at home in city traffic and on the open road. </p>
                <p>The transmission will be a  <span class="font-weight-700">six-speed gearbox, paired with a slip-and-assist clutch</span> for lighter lever action and to prevent wheel hop during aggressive downshifts. The bike is also expected to have  <span class="font-weight-700">ride-by-wire throttle technology, </span> ensuring precise and immediate throttle response. <span class="font-weight-700">Switchable traction control</span> will be a welcome feature, providing an added layer of safety, especially on slippery surfaces. </p>
                <p>The chassis is expected to be a hybrid spine/perimeter tubular steel frame with a bolt-on rear subframe, offering a great balance of rigidity and feel. For suspension, we can anticipate the same  <span class="font-weight-700">43mm upside-down (USD) </span> Big Piston forks at the front and a monoshock with preload adjustment at the rear. The braking duties are likely to be handled by a single front disc and a single rear disc, equipped with a  <span class="font-weight-700">dual-channel ABS. </span></p>
                <p>What will truly set the Tracker apart are the specific components that define its style. It's expected to feature a more minimalist, stripped-down look. A key design element will be the side panels with space for racing numbers, a signature of flat trackers. The exhaust is also expected to be different, possibly a high-slung unit, which would further enhance its rugged aesthetic. </p>
                <p>Here is a summary of the expected specifications: </p>

                        <li><span class="font-weight-700">Tyres: </span> Expected to be more street-focused than the Scrambler 400 X, possibly with a slightly different tread pattern.</li>

                    <h3 class="subheading">Features That Define the Tracker Experience</h3>

                    <p>The Triumph Speed 400 Tracker is expected to combine <span class="font-weight-700">classic looks with modern features</span> to deliver a compelling riding package. The instrument cluster will likely be a semi-digital unit, with an analog speedometer and an <span class="font-weight-700">integrated multi-function LCD screen</span> providing information such as gear position, fuel level, and trip details. </p>
                    <p>The lighting system is expected to be full-LED, which is now a standard for premium bikes in this segment. The motorcycle will also likely feature a ride-by-wire throttle for precise control and switchable traction control, which is a significant safety feature. The slip-and-assist clutch will make city riding a breeze by reducing clutch lever effort. </p>
                    <p>A notable difference from its siblings will be the styling. The spied images indicate a slightly different subframe and tail section, which will give it a unique stance. The ergonomics are also expected to be slightly altered to suit the flat tracker style, possibly with a wider handlebar for better leverage. At <span class="font-weight-700">BikeCarHub, </span> we are particularly excited about how these subtle changes will translate to a new and engaging riding experience. </p>
                    <h3 class="subheading">A Head-to-Head with the Competition</h3>
                    <p>The sub-400cc segment is incredibly competitive in India, with several manufacturers offering compelling products. The Triumph Speed 400 Tracker will have to contend with rivals that offer a mix of performance, features, and heritage. Here's a quick comparison to see where it stands against some of its key competitors. </p>

                    <p>This comparison highlights the Triumph Speed 400 Tracker's key strengths. It is expected to be a performance leader in its class, with the highest power output. While it might be a bit more expensive than the likes of the Yezdi and Honda, it offers a more powerful, liquid-cooled engine and a premium brand cachet. It will be interesting to see how it stacks up against the upcoming Royal Enfield Scram 440, which is also expected to offer a modern, performance-oriented engine. </p>
