                <p>The name Norton is synonymous with British motorcycling heritage—a century-old story of racing glory, iconic design, and machines that stir the soul. In recent years, under the steady and strategic ownership of India’s TVS Motor Company, the brand is experiencing a magnificent resurgence. And at the forefront of this new era stands the latest iteration of their flagship superbike: the all-new <span class="font-weight-700">Norton V4</span>.</p>
                <p>This isn't just a bike; it's a statement. It's the culmination of painstaking re-engineering, significant investment, and a determined effort to reclaim its position among the world's elite high-performance motorcycles. For enthusiasts and prospective owners, the waiting game is almost over, and the buzz around this machine is reaching a fever pitch. Get ready to dive deep into the specifications, expected performance, pricing, and the sheer exhilaration promised by the new-generation <span class="font-weight-700">Norton V4, </span>a machine we here at <a class="for-link" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Index"> BikeCarHub,</a> believe is poised to redefine the segment.</p>
                <h3 class="subheading">A Legacy Reimagined: The New V4 Takes Shape</h3>
                <div class="row m-b20">
                    <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 text-center image-height"><img src="~/images/twowheeler/upcomming/2025/norton v4/black.webp" alt="black" title="black" loading="lazy" /></div>
                </div>

                <p>The<span class="font-weight-700"> new Norton V4 </span>is set to succeed the acclaimed V4SV, and early glimpses via spy shots suggest a more aggressive, modern, and globally competitive design. The V4SV already set a high bar with its exquisite craftsmanship—featuring an exposed, mirror-polished aluminium tube frame, premium components, and an unmistakable British flair. The upcoming model, however, looks ready to shed some of that retro-inspired styling for a truly contemporary superbike silhouette, one that can go toe-to-toe with the world’s best on the showroom floor and on the racetrack.</p>
                <p>Sources indicate that Norton has listened to the market, focusing on compliance, performance, and cutting-edge technology. The shift in design philosophy hints at improved aerodynamics, better mass centralisation, and an overall package engineered for peak performance. This new machine represents the true global ambition of the TVS-backed Norton, designed to meet modern emission standards (like Euro 5+) and finally conquer markets beyond the UK.</p>
                <h3 class="subheading">Expected Technical Specifications: The Heart of the Beast</h3>
                <p>
                    While official, final figures for the all-new Norton V4 are still under wraps, the bike is expected to carry forward a heavily revised version of Norton’s own in-house developed V4 engine. This unit is a masterpiece of engineering, designed to deliver power with a uniquely British character.

                <p><span class="font-weight-700">The Power Play: </span>The most critical expected update lies in the power output. To truly compete with its Italian and German rivals, the new V4 must cross the 200 horsepower mark. This increase will likely be achieved through internal engine revisions, lighter components, and a sophisticated, Euro 5+ compliant exhaust system—possibly a new underbelly unit as hinted in spy shots, which would also aid in better mass centralisation.</p>
                <h3 class="subheading">Key Features: Technology Meets Tradition</h3>
                <p>The Norton V4 is set to be a showcase of premium componentry and advanced rider aids. It will blend the classic craftsmanship of a TIG-welded, mirror-polished frame with the latest in performance technology.</p>
                The Electronic Suite
                <p>The new V4 will be a tech-laden motorcycle, featuring a comprehensive electronics package governed by a <span class="font-weight-700">Six-Axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). </span>This IMU is the brain behind sophisticated systems, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-700"> Lean-Angle Sensitive Traction Control (TC): </span>Offering seamless control when accelerating out of a corner.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-700">  Cornering ABS:</span> Ensuring optimal braking performance even when leaned over.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-700">Multiple Engine Modes: </span>Expected to include at least Wet, Road, and Sport settings, each customising power delivery and electronic intervention levels.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-700">   Full Quick Shifter and Auto Blipper: </span>Allowing for lightning-fast, clutch-less upshifts and downshifts.</li>
                    <li>  <span class="font-weight-700"> Full-Colour TFT Display:</span> A large, modern instrument panel, possibly a 6-inch or 7-inch unit, with auto-brightness adjustment and excellent readability.</li>
                </ul>
                High-End Componentry
                <p>The motorcycle’s exclusivity is cemented by its choice of parts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-700"> Suspension: </span>Fully adjustable, top-of-the-line Öhlins units, ensuring a sublime balance between track-day precision and road comfort. The possibility of semi-active electronic suspension is a highly anticipated addition to keep pace with rivals.</li>
                    <li> <span class="font-weight-700"> Braking: </span>Brembo components are a non-negotiable for a superbike of this calibre. The expected inclusion of Brembo's Hypure monobloc calipers, as seen on other top-tier superbikes, signals an intent for unmatched stopping power.</li>
                    <li> <span class="font-weight-700">   Materials: </span>Extensive use of carbon fibre for the bodywork and the under-seat fuel tank, with models like the 'Carbon' variant expected to feature lightweight Carbon Fibre BST wheels. The billet-machined yokes, footrests, and pedals are all meticulously crafted pieces that highlight the attention to detail Norton is famous for.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="subheading">Expected Price and Launch Timeline</h3>
                <p>Norton Motorcycles is a luxury brand, and the V4 is their flagship offering. Consequently, it commands a premium price reflective of its exotic components, handcrafted frame, and limited production volume.</p>
                <p><span class="font-weight-700">Expected Price</span>
                <p>The previous V4SV was priced at £44,000 in the UK, which converted to a significantly higher figure in markets like India due to import duties.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-700">UK Price (Expected):</span> The new V4 is likely to be priced competitively with other premium European superbikes, possibly starting around <span class="font-weight-700">£21,000 - £26,000 </span>for the base variant.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-weight-700">  India Price (Expected): </span>Should the motorcycle arrive as a Completely Built Unit (CBU), the ex-showroom price could range from <span class="font-weight-700">₹25,00,000 to ₹30,00,000 </span>(Ex-Showroom, Delhi/Mumbai) or even higher, positioning it as one of the most expensive and exclusive superbikes in the country. Prices may vary significantly depending on the final assembly strategy and local taxation.</li>
                </ul>
                Expected Launch Timeline
                <p>The new Norton V4 has been the subject of intensive development under TVS’s ownership, specifically targeting global market compliance.</p>

                <h3 class="subheading">The Contender: Comparison with Key Competitors</h3>
                <p>The Norton V4 enters one of the most fiercely contested segments in motorcycling—the elite V4 and inline-four superbikes. Its direct competition includes the very best that Italy and Germany have to offer. The Norton V4's edge, however, will always be its British heritage, exclusivity, and the unique character of its 72-degree V4 engine.</p>
