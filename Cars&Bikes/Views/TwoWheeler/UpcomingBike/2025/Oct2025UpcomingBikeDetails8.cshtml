                <h3 class="subheading">A Legacy of Supermoto Prowess</h3>
                <p>KTM has a rich history in the supermoto world. The brand's philosophy of "Ready to Race" is deeply embedded in its DNA, and this is nowhere more evident than in its supermoto lineup. The 390 SMC R inherits this legacy, but it does so with a modern twist, making it accessible to a broader audience without compromising on performance. It's a bike that encourages you to lean deeper, brake later, and smile wider.</p>
                <h3 class="subheading">Design and Ergonomics: Built for Aggression</h3>
                <p>The <span class="font-weight-700">KTM 390 SMC R's</span> design is unapologetically aggressive. It sports a lean, minimalist bodywork that screams performance. Every line and curve is purposeful, contributing to the bike's lightweight feel and sharp handling. The high-set fenders, the sleek tank, and the exposed chassis all come together to create a look that is unmistakably KTM. The seating position is upright and commanding, perfect for navigating tight city streets or carving through twisty back roads. The wide handlebars give you excellent leverage, allowing you to flick the bike from side to side with minimal effort. This ergonomic setup is one of the key reasons why the 390 SMC R feels so connected to the rider.</p>
                <h3 class="subheading">Engine and Performance: The Heart of a Supermoto</h3>
                <p>At the core of the <span class="font-weight-700">KTM 390 SMC R</span> lies its potent 398.7cc single-cylinder, liquid-cooled engine. This motor is a gem, known for its punchy low-to-mid range torque and a willingness to rev. It's the same reliable engine found in the Duke and RC 390 models, but here, it's tuned for a different kind of delivery. The single-cylinder throb is charismatic, and the power delivery is linear, making it predictable and easy to manage, even for riders new to the supermoto style.<br /><br />
                    The bike's power-to-weight ratio is a major highlight. With a lightweight chassis and a powerful engine, the 390 SMC R feels incredibly quick and agile. It accelerates with urgency and is a joy to ride in urban environments where its nimble nature allows it to slice through traffic effortlessly. The slipper clutch is a fantastic addition, preventing wheel hop during aggressive downshifts and adding a layer of safety and control.
                </p>
                <h3 class="subheading">Handling and Suspension: Precision is Key</h3>
                <p>The chassis of the 390 SMC R is where KTM's engineering shines. It features a lightweight steel trellis frame that provides a perfect balance of rigidity and flex. This frame, combined with the high-quality suspension components, gives the bike its telepathic handling. The front forks are WP Apex upside-down units, and the rear shock is a WP Apex monoshock. This suspension setup is fully adjustable, allowing riders to fine-tune the bike's behavior to their specific riding style and conditions.<br /><br />
                    The supermoto-specific wheels and tires are crucial to the bike's performance. The 17-inch spoked wheels wrapped in sticky supermoto tires provide phenomenal grip on the tarmac. The brakes are equally impressive, featuring a large disc at the front with a radial-mounted caliper, offering strong and progressive stopping power. The ABS system, which can be turned off for the rear wheel, allows for some supermoto antics like sliding into corners, a feature that experienced riders will appreciate.
                </p>
                <h3 class="subheading">Key Features and Technology</h3>
                <p>The KTM 390 SMC R is not just about raw performance; it's also packed with modern technology. The full-color TFT display is a standout feature, providing all the essential information in a clear and easy-to-read format. It includes a gear position indicator, a fuel gauge, and even a shift light. The display is also equipped with Bluetooth connectivity, allowing you to connect your smartphone for turn-by-turn navigation and call management.<br /><br />
                    Other notable features include LED lighting all around, which not only looks modern but also provides excellent visibility. The ride-by-wire throttle offers precise throttle response, and the traction control system adds an extra layer of safety. The bike's overall build quality is impressive, with high-quality components and a fit-and-finish that feels premium.
                </p>
                <h3 class="subheading">Competitor Comparison</h3>
                <p>When you're considering a bike like the KTM 390 SMC R, it's natural to look at its rivals.
