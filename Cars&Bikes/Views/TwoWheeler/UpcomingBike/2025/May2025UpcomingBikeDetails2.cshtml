            <h3 class="subheading">Yezdi Adventure 2025: New Model Launching on 4th June</h3>
            <p>Motorcycle enthusiasts in India have a reason to get excited as <span class="font-weight-700">Yezdi</span> prepares to unveil the <span class="font-weight-700">2025 Yezdi Adventure</span> on<span class="font-weight-700"> 4th June 2025. </span>Known for its rugged design and touring capabilities, the updated model aims to bring a refreshing twist to the adventure bike segment with aesthetic upgrades, enhanced features, and compliance with the latest emission norms.</p>
            <p>Let’s take a closer look at what’s expected from this highly anticipated two-wheeler.</p>
            <div class="row m-b20">
                <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 text-center"><img src="~/images/twowheeler/upcomming/2025/yezdiadventure11.png" alt="yezdiadventure11" title="yezdiadventure11" /></div>
            </div>
            <div class="div-line"></div>
            <h3 class="subheading">Updated Design and Styling</h3>
            <p>The 2025 Yezdi Adventure gets a visual makeover while staying true to its off-road DNA. The most noticeable update is the <span class="font-weight-700"> new asymmetrical LED headlamp, </span>offering better illumination and lending the bike a more modern and aggressive appearance. This feature aligns it with global adventure bikes like the BMW G310 GS, giving it a premium edge.</p>
            <p>Other design tweaks may include refreshed color schemes, improved paint quality, and minor body enhancements that enhance both aesthetics and aerodynamics.</p>
            <div class="row m-b20">
                <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 text-center"><img src="~/images/twowheeler/upcomming/2025/adventurerightsideview.webp" alt="adventurerightsideview" title="adventurerightsideview.webp" /></div>
            </div>
            <div class="div-line"></div>
            <h3 class="subheading">Engine and Emission Compliance</h3>
            <p>Yezdi is expected to retain the same <span class="font-weight-700"> 334cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled engine </span>that powered the outgoing model. This powerplant produces around <span class="font-weight-700"> 29.2 bhp </span>and <span class="font-weight-700">29.84 Nm of torque, </span>paired with a <span class="font-weight-700">6-speed transmission.</span> However, the key update for 2025 is the engine's compliance with the <span class="font-weight-700">OBD-2B emission norms,</span> making it greener and more efficient in line with the government’s latest environmental mandates.</p>
            <p>Riders can expect the same reliable performance on highways, hills, and rough terrains, making it suitable for both city commuting and long-distance adventures.</p>
            <div class="div-line"></div>
            <h3 class="subheading">Feature-Rich and Adventure-Ready</h3>
            <p>The upcoming Yezdi Adventure isn’t just about looks. It will continue offering a range of features that are essential for modern-day touring and off-road biking, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="font-weight-700">Fully digital LCD instrument cluster </span>with Bluetooth connectivity</li>
                <li><span class="font-weight-700">Turn-by-turn navigation</span></li>
                <li><span class="font-weight-700">USB charging port</span></li>

                <li><span class="font-weight-700">Long-travel front forks and rear monoshock suspension</span></li>
                <li><span class="font-weight-700">Split seating for enhanced comfort on long rides</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>These features aim to strike the right balance between utility and comfort for both solo riders and pillion passengers.</p>
            <div class="div-line"></div>
            <h3 class="subheading">Price Expectations</h3>
